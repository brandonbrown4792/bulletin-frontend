# Bulletin Frontend
Bulletin is a social networking platform centered around news. As the rise of social media continues, younger generations stray away from traditional news sites and articles and turn to resources such as Twitter and Facebook. This app seeks to combine traditional news outlets with a social media interface for a more captivating and engaging experience. With Bulletin, users are able to follow specific news sources or interests as well as follow other users. Using this approach, Bulletin strives to become a one-stop-shop news outlet for any generational user.
